### Description

This is just a simple little game I made. You have to hit the right key (shown at the bottom - A,S,D,J,K,L) anytime after the block gets by the red line. But make sure it doesn't hit the bottom or it's game over! Sound easy right? Wrong - it gets harder. If the block turns red you have to hit the key 2x!!! Wow. Heheh, give it a try and let me know what you think.
